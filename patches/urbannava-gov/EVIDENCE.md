# Earshot — accessibility remediation proposal for https://urbannava.gov/

**This is a reviewable patch proposal with verification evidence, not a compliance claim.** Earshot flags what it cannot determine instead of guessing. An agent proposes; a human disposes — nothing here should be read as "compliant" or "fully accessible."

## What this PR is and isn't

This diffs a snapshot of the fetched HTML against Earshot's proposed DOM mutations for https://urbannava.gov/. **It is not a pull request against that site's actual source repository** — we don't have access to it. It's a reviewable proposal in the shape a real PR would take, for the site owner or for demo purposes, opened against this repo.

## Grader A — axe-core violations

Before: **64**
After: **64**
Removed keys: (none)
Added keys (should be empty — the verifier reverts any fix that adds one): (none)

## Grader B — narration comprehension

Before: 3/5 — The page has clear navigation links and many labeled headings for news items, but several unlabeled elements (link, image, and five headings) create confusion. A blind user can access most information but may struggle to understand the structure and purpose of some sections.
After: 4/5 — Most content is structured with clear headings and labeled links, allowing a blind user to understand announcements and navigate. However, several unlabeled elements and fragmented text reduce full clarity, making some parts inaccessible or confusing.

## Flagged for human review (1)

A good flag rate is a feature — every item below is something the model declined to guess at.

- `button-name` iframe — Button purpose cannot be determined from the given context.: There is no visible text, title, or surrounding information to infer an appropriate aria-label, so a reliable accessible name cannot be generated.
